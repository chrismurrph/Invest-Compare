Invest Compare
==============

On LHS have how your financial planner went managing your money
This is called the fund. We should not need to care about the actual funds he invests in
On RHS what if this money was invested with a wholesale fund
The investment period will be from the day the first amount was introduced to the financial planner to yesterday

LHS - Financial planner
-----------------------

Money is either going into the fund or coming out of it
There are two actors: investor and (financial) planner
With two actors and two types of events then on any date zero or more of four things can take place:
1. investor puts money in
2. investor takes money out
3. planner puts money in (proceeds of his investments)
4. planner takes money out (his own charges or charges of his funds)

Hopefully we can get this information from existing reports delivered to the investor/client

RHS - Wholesale fund
--------------------

The unit price varies every day over the investment period.
It is assumed we know this stream of unit prices and have an IRR function
It is assumed that the unit prices stream abstracts over all expenses and revenue gained from the wholesale fund
This is a big IF - what about startup and exit fees?
The only other input is 1 and 2 from above. We need to assume the investor puts money in and takes it out from this wholesale fund

IRR function
------------

Complex and needs to be described. Do we need a stream of CPI figures to take account of inflation as well?

Result
------

How well the financial planner did compared to the wholesale fund in one amount, in terms of today's dollars.
